# Linear & Logistic Regression From Scratch (Python + NumPy + Matplotlib)
This project demonstrates **Linear Regression** and **Logistic Regression** built **completely from scratch** using `numpy` and `matplotlib` (without using sklearn models).  
Both models are trained, evaluated, and visualized with **animated plots, metrics, and loss curves**.

## Features

✅ Linear Regression:
- Gradient Descent implementation  
- Forward & Backpropagation  
- Animated training with regression line updates (`.gif`)  
- Error metrics: **MSE, RMSE, MAE, R²**  

✅ Logistic Regression:
- Binary classification using sigmoid activation  
- Gradient Descent optimization  
- Accuracy & Precision metrics  
- Visual comparison of train vs test predictions
